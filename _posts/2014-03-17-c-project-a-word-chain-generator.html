<p>I was recently tasked with writing a program that takes an input file consisting of words, process it, and then output all word chains present in the file. For this particular task, a word chain was defined as a sequence of words in which adjacent pairs have an edit distance of 1. For example, the following would be considered a word chain:</p>
<pre><center>moon soon son one tone lone</center></pre>
<p>The main goal of this task was to find chains that were as long and interesting as possible.</p>
<p>To store the word chains, I chose to utilize a <span class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true  crayon-inline">vector</span> containing pointers to objects which are my own implementation of a double ended queue. I could have used two vectors instead, but I saw tremendous educational value in writing my own implementation of the double ended queue.</p>
<p>The program reads in words one at a time from a file, and then calls a member function which adds the word to an existing chain, or creates a new one if necessary. It sounds simple, but there are a lot of cases to consider. For example, what if a word was not to appear more than once in a chain? Or if chains are set to grow one step at a time, for example:</p>
<pre><center>a at ate rate irate pirate pirated</center></pre>
<p>Such restrictions help generate more interesting word chains, but at a cost in terms of worst case execution time. For example, checking for duplicates before adding a word to a chain requires the program to walk through the entire data structure. That itself can slow things down drastically when reading in words from a file that is large in size.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let's take this word chain generator for a spin.</p>
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true">Usage:./WordChainGenerator [OPTIONS] command command...
        --target-file [/path/to/file.txt]
        File to read words from. REQUIRED.

        --log-file [true/false]
        Stores all output into a file called chain_log.txt in current working directory. Recommended when using large target files. DEFAULT VALUE: false. OPTIONAL.

        --allow-duplicates [true/false]
        Prevents adding a word to a chain more than once. Caveat: can have drastic impact on run time when processing large text files. DEFAULT VALUE: true. OPTIONAL.

        --step-growth [true/false]
        Sets whether chains should grow at each step when being constructed. e.g. farm-form-for-nor-or. DEFAULT VALUE: false. OPTIONAL.

        --filter-length [integer]
        Filter out words that have a length less than or equal to the specified value. DEFAULT VALUE: 0. OPTIONAL.</pre>
<p>It turns out that some interesting chains can be found when running the program against a text copy of <a href="https://sherlock-holm.es/stories/plain-text/advs.txt"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes</span></a>.</p>
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true">./WordChainGenerator --target-file SherlockHolmes.txt --filter-length 2 --log-file true</pre>
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true">----------------------------------------------

<p>Running the program with <span class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true  crayon-inline"><code>--allow-step-growth true</code></span>  and <span class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true  crayon-inline "><code>--allow-duplicates false</code></span> , the result is:</p>

<p>And that's only from a single text source. It should be interested to see the interesting chains that can be generated by trying different text sources and command line options!</p>
