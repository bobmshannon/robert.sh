<p>I own a Accord Coupe. It's a great car, except it can be quite noisy at times. In particular the rear shelf rattles heavily with even just a low amount of bass from the sound system. In fact there was a service bulletin put out to fix this issue, but when I had it applied at the dealer it didn't help at all.</p>
<p>After having the TSB done to address the issue of the rear shelf rattle with no success, I started to look into some sound deadening hoping that it would fix my issue once and for all. I purchased about 4sq feet of Dynamat, removed the rear shelf, and then applied the dynamat to the sheet metal below the rear shelf. That worked pretty good, it minimized the severity of the problem but it did not go away completely. After further research I discovered that it is common practice to layer CCF (closed cell foam) on interior panels in order to stop them from rattling against the sheet metal. So, I then bought a water proof, closed cell, camping pad from walmart for about $9 (you can also buy something specifically made for automotive use), removed the rear shelf yet again, and then added a layer of this camping pad.</p>
<p>The rattle is now gone! Here are some pictures.</p>

<p>Since I had some velcro lying around, I used it to attach the foam pad to the rear shelf. This made it a lot easier when reinstalling it.</p>
