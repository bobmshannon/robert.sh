<p>Many times it is useful to import or export a database via command line. For those of you who have used database management tools such as phpMyAdmin, you are aware how much of a pain it is importing or exporting large databases due to limits in PHP such as <code>max_execution_time</code>.</p>
<h1>Importing a MySQL database</h1>
<pre class="lang:sh highlight:0 decode:true">mysql -u USERNAME -p DATABASE_NAME &lt; BACKUP_NAME.sql</pre>
<p>Note that -p specified that we are going to login with a password. We <strong>never</strong> specify a password directly due to security reasons, as every command you type is stored in a file called .bash_history.</p>
<h1>Exporting a MySQL database</h1>
<p>This command is exactly the same as the one used for importing, with two slight differences. We replace <code>&lt;</code> with <code>&gt;</code> and <code>mysql</code> with <code>mysqldump</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">mysqldump -u USERNAME -p DATABASE_NAME &gt; BACKUP_NAME.sql</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
